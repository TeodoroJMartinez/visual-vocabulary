Small examples of data driven graphics -- to be used as starting points for static graphics to be further refined through Illustrator.
[Viewable here](http://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/)


# Getting started

For ease of use we suggest you use [`srvlr`](https://github.com/kavanagh/srvlr) to help you see your changes reflected immediately in your browser.

If you have srvlr installed using it is as simple as opening terminal, navigating to the location of you project and typing `srvlr`


# Setting up a Mac for editing the examples

 * Install Node.js from here https://nodejs.org
 * Open up Terminal app
 * Install srvlr `npm install -g srvlr` (if you see errors you may need to try `sudo npm install -g srvlr` which will then prompt you for your password)
 * Make sure Git is installed, type `git` into the command line. If it's not installed your Mac should take over and install it for you.


# Getting a local copy of the examples

i.e. copying them to your computer. either : [Download them from here](https://github.com/ft-interactive/visual-vocabulary/archive/main.zip)
or in the terminal window type `git clone https://github.com/ft-interactive/graphics-examples.git TARGET-LOCATION`

replacing `TARGET-LOCATION` with the name of the folder you wish to put the examples in.
